After spending over a decade in the actuarial profession, I've rediscovered a lifelong passion for developing and have started to build my career as a software engineer. By day I'm a Software Engineer II on an amazing team at [FiscalNote](https://www.fiscalnote.com/), and by night I'm working toward a graduate degree in the University of Pennsylvania's MCIT program (~August 2023).
