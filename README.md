After spending over a decade in the actuarial profession, I rediscovered a lifelong passion for developing and started to build my career as a software engineer. I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer on the Enterprise Workflow Solutions team at Capital One.

My first opportunity as a Software Engineer was on the Curate team at FiscalNote. I contributed to development of the app across the full stack (database, backend, frontend) with an awesome developer team, and eventually had the opportunity to participate in both a product rebuild and a greenfield new product launch. While at FiscalNote, I finished a master's degree in Computer and Information Technology at the University of Pennsylvania as a part-time student.
