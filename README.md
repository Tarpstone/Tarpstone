After spending over a decade in the actuarial profession, I rediscovered a lifelong passion for developing and started to build my career as a software engineer. During 2022/2023 I gained valuable full-time experience as an engineer at FiscalNote and Capital One, and completed a master's degree in Computer and Information Technology at the University of Pennsylvania.
